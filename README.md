# Wireless Air Mouse

The wireless air mouse operates on a straightforward concept, which involves utilizing an accelerometer to capture the acceleration values of hand gestures along the x and y-axis using Arduino. The accelerometer data is then transmitted to the computer using a Bluetooth Module which will be utilized by Python software drivers running on the computer to control the mouse cursor and execute specific actions.


## Pre-requisites

    1. Arduino Nano (any model)
    2. Accelerometer ADXL335 Module
    3. Bluetooth HC-05 Module
    4. Push buttons
    5. Python Installed computer
